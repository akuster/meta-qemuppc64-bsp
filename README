This README file contains information on building the meta-karch
BSP layer, and booting the images contained in the /binary directory.

Building the meta-qemuppc84-bsp  BSP layer
========================================


In order to build an image with BSP support for a given release, you
need to download the corresponding BSP tarball from the 'Board Support
Package (BSP) Downloads' page of the Yocto Project website.

Having done that, and assuming you extracted the BSP tarball contents
at the top-level of your yocto build tree, you can build a
qemuppc64 image by adding the location of the meta-qemuppc64-bsp
layer to bblayers.conf, along with any other layers needed (to access
common metadata shared between BSPs) e.g.:

  {PATH TO}/meta-qemuppc64-bsp \

To enable the karch layer, add the karch MACHINE to local.conf:

  MACHINE ?= "qemuppc64"

Remove image-prelink from local.conf

You should then be able to build a qemuppc64 image as such:

  $ source oe-init-build-env
  $ bitbake core-image-minimal
